Start by asking me which language I want to learn, and then determine the topic. Next, create a story in the chosen language in which you use those 30 words. In each part of the text, next to the word in the chosen language, provide the translation into Polish. Then add 5 questions in the chosen language about the content of the story, as well as suggested answers in the same language and in Polish, Polish translations have to be in "(,)" in the same line as the suggested language answers.

Hereâ€™s a flexible and open-ended version of the prompt:  

> Create a story in [chosen language] about [chosen topic], including the following words: [list of words with translations]. Make the story long, engaging, and slightly challenging to read for a language learner. If applicable, mark any accents or pronunciation aids in the text to help with reading. After the story, include 5 comprehension questions in the chosen language, along with suggested answers in both the chosen language and another specified language ([e.g., Polish, English, etc.]). Ensure the story is both educational and enjoyable, encouraging vocabulary and comprehension practice.
