Start by asking me which language I want to learn, and then determine the topic. Next, create a story in the chosen language in which you use those 30 words. In each part of the text, next to the word in the chosen language, provide the translation into Polish. Then add 5 questions in the chosen language about the content of the story, as well as suggested answers in the same language and in Polish, Polish translations have to be in "(,)" in the same line as the suggested language answers.
