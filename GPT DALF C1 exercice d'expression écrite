✅ Final Prompt – DALF C1 Writing Exercises

Create a list of 20 short and varied writing exercises designed to prepare for the DALF C1 exam.

Each exercise should be:

    Clear and fully self-contained (no placeholders, no imagined or inserted texts).

    1 to 3 sentences long and ready to use as-is on an A4 sheet.

    Focused on the following skills:

        Giving nuanced opinions on various subjects

        Reformulation (in more formal or elegant French)

        Summarizing and synthesizing ideas into 1–2 sentences

        Combining sentences using appropriate logical connectors (e.g., bien que, pourtant, en effet, néanmoins, même si, toutefois, car, donc, etc.)

        Expressing a structured argument with connecteurs logiques

        Using C1-level structures and vocabulary (e.g., il va sans dire que, il convient de noter que, certes… mais, il serait exagéré de dire que, etc.)

🔒 Avoid:

    Vague or overly general questions

    Instructions like “insérer un texte” or “imaginez un thème”

    Any exercise that requires creating additional content before doing the task

The language of the exercises should be French only (without model answers).
