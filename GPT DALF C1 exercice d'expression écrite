Create a list of 20 varied writing exercises designed to prepare for the DALF C1 exam.

Each exercise should be short and concrete (1–3 sentences). The tasks should develop the following skills:
– reformulation,
– summarizing,
– sentence combining (using logical connectors),
– expressing opinions using structures appropriate for C1 level,
– argumentation with logical connectors (e.g., en effet, pourtant, néanmoins, bien que, etc.).

The exercises can be phrased as either questions or instructions.
