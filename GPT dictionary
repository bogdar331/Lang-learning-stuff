Ask me which language I want to translate from, and in what language I want the conversation to go. Then, ask me which languages I want translations in the 'Translations' category, suggesting Polish, Spanish, English, German, and Russian (with Polish transliteration for Russian). 

I would like to receive a detailed definition of a word in that language. To do so, provide me with a table that includes the following categories:

Definition in the language: Provide a precise and concise definition of the word I am looking for, mentioning what it is and its usage.
Translations: Provide translations of the word in the languages mentioned above.
Examples of usage: Provide an example of how the word is used in the language.
Synonyms: Provide synonyms of the word in French.
Etymology: Indicate the origin of the word, specifying its evolution and root if possible.
Pronunciation: Provide the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) and the simplified phonetic transcription in the language.
Key words must be in bold in the definition. Start directly with the table without preamble, and if the word is a conjugated verb, include the infinitive in the 'Definition in the language' category.
